# Captcha Bypassing Lab

## ⭕ Installation:
You can set-up a totally functional captcha for practicing bypassing in your localhost, with just 

executing my script ***autocaptcha*** that downloads and configure the 2 different templates, one with a simple

captcha input, and other with captcha and login at the same time:

    wget "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/D3Ext/PentestDictionary/main/Captcha-Bypassing/auto-captcha.sh" &>/dev/null ; chmod +x autocaptcha.sh ; sudo ./autocaptcha.sh 

## ⭕ Demo:
